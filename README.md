# Alzheimer-Data-Analysis
Data analysis and predictive models based on Alzheimer patients data.

Dataset source:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset

Packages Versions:
- pandas: 2.2.2
- seaborn: 0.13.2
- matplotlib: 3.9.2
- scikit-klearn: 1.5.1
- catboost: 1.2.7

### The Data
The dataset includes information on 2,149 patients, some diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and others not.<br>
Each patient has a set of features that can be categorized into four main groups:
1. Population characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnicity, education)
2. Medical indicators and background (e.g., blood pressure, weight, cholesterol, family history of Alzheimer’s)
3. Habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol consuming, physical activity)
4. Cognitive ability reports (e.g., confusion, disorientation, memory complaints)

### Our Goals
By analyzing the data we would like to achieve two goals:
1. Identifying and understanding the factors influencing Alzheimer’s disease morbidity.
2. Developing a model to predict the onset of Alzheimer’s disease in patients.

The assumptions, methods, full workflow documentation, insights and summary documented in Alzheimer.ipynb.
